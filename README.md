# WWDC2024
Swift Student Challenge Submission for **WWDC** 2024 - **Parsing Pipelines (SwiftUI)**

# App Overview

This app demonstrates a brief introduction to how programming languages, compilers and parsers work under the hood with a step by step animated analysis involving interactive scenes. 

It helps developers visualise and breakdown the expressions which are human-readable in different components like tokens, expressions, parse trees, all the way to the intermediate representation and target machine code. 

Utilising SwiftUI and its various flexible modern interface declarations allowed me to develop complex animations and views which makes the overall user experience appealing. 

In terms of technologies used, it purely uses SwiftUI and its components with custom-implemented data structures and algorithmic implementations used throughout the app playground that have been well described in the codebase. 

Although being a relatively brief insight, it can be further enhanced to support various parts during the compilation process to bring more beginners into the community and potentially involving them to contribute to the open source libraries like Swift and LLVM compilers which continually strive to improve language runtime semantics.

# Swift Packages/Libraries used

This app submission uses an open source SwiftUI library [ConfettiSwiftUI](https://github.com/simibac/ConfettiSwiftUI), it allows you to create and customize confetti animations. This custom library being a swift package allows me to use the confetti animations without having to re-invent the wheel for a particular view in my app playground. 

The handy view modifier provides a variety of options to enhance the user experience with smooth animations.
